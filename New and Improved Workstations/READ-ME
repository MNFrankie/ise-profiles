This is my swing at correcting some of the built-in workstation profiles. I did the following:
- Changed some of the certainty factors on less relevant profiles
- Adding relevant DHCP parameter requests 
- Added DHCP class identifiers
- Added User-Agent information
- Added device-type information
- Added AD operating system probe
- Added a new nested profile under each Windows type for domain-joined PC to differentiate between domain-joined PCs and non-domain-joined PCs.

As always, these are not profiles officially endorsed or pushed by Cisco so test it out in a lab before putting it into production.
