# ise-profiles

Hello Viewers,

Since I've been creating custom profiles for clients and testing many times in the past, I created this repository to share the ISE profiles I've created over time. Some of them are as simple as OUI contains <company name> and others are more complex. It all depends on the probes that the clients had turned on or were willing to turn on. Since I was working with a limited data set, I've had situations where I've come back to update an old profile I created in the past because a customer with more probes turned on yielded more granular details. I will attempt to update these profiles in this repository as I come across that in my clients. 

With that being said, this is not an official Cisco Github. This is not endorsed or supported officially by Cisco in any way and if you choose to use these profiles, please test them first before putting them in production. I try my best to provide quality work but sometimes products, software, etc changes and the profiles might need adjusting. 

I chose to upload the profiles one-by-one instead of a bulk upload for two reasons:

1. To allow people to have the choice to pick which profiles to pick so they don't override their own custom profiles
2. Like any software, there are limits on how many custom profiles that may be created. If you mass imported everything I create all-at-once with an ISE deployment that has a large amount of custom profiles, you might hit the limit. 

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out on my contact form of my blog at network-node.com.
